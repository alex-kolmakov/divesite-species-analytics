# Divesite Species Analytics Data Pipeline 

Project aims to combine several scientific occurence datasets to provide ability to analyze them through the species distribution and divesite proximity.


### Setup

For the setup please proceed to the [documentation](documentation/setup.md).


### Architecture Diagram

### Data modelling

Project mimics medallion architecture with the following layers:

- **Substrate** - contains raw external data from the sources.
- **Skeleton** - contains joined and cleaned data for individual dimensions and facts.
- **Coral** - final aggregated data for the analytics.


### Main Occurences model:
| Column Name    | Data Type   |   Description     |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| species        | STRING      | String representation of the species name.              |
| individualcount| INTEGER     | Amount of individauls per  1 sighting (e.g. "I saw 5 ducks")              |
| eventdate      | TIMESTAMP   | Timestamp of the occurence               |
| geography      | GEOGRAPHY   | BigQuery type of geography marker: POINT()                |
| source         | STRING      | Source dataset from which occurence originated from                |
| is_invasive    | BOOLEAN     | Species considered invasive               |
| is_endangered  | BOOLEAN     | Species considered endangered            |
